# Notes from code review 4/15/2016 - MikeG

* Missing getting started guide/prerequisites - as a developer who is interested in contributing to Marvin, I would like a *Getting Started* guide that leads me through the process to go from cloning repo to running Marvin and the test suite so that I minimize the amount of time I need to spend getting up and running.
